						Welcome to this talk. I realized when I was writing this talk, that the title sounds like something you would expect to be a bit enterprise-focused. This sounds boring to me, so I made a little twist. To those of you who wanted a boring enterprise talk, I truly am sorry. This is content driven e-commerce, a love story. !! !!

							I am going to talk partly about some things that comes from an interesting cooperation we had at our company with 3 master students in Media, Communication and Information Technology. They studied what would make a good web strategy for a brand new web shop. So this is the research project I will be referring to throughout the talk.

						But I will come to that. First I want to come back to the title: the love story. We are going to follow two young people on their adventures in love. And we will look at 3 scenes from their lives: The aquarium scene, the balcony scene and the dramatic ending. The story about content and e-commerce is a love story. It’s a classic drama of families and forbidden love.

							## Meet Romeo
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Meet Romeo. Romeo comes from the content family, a family of poets and artists. Their history includes highly praised theatre plays, classical novels and enchanting paintings. Their world view is that of a romantic, they see the beauty in the world, and they provide beauty to the people.

							## Meet Julian
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
							Meet Julian. Julian comes from the e-commerce family. They are a merchant family, with a long history of buying and selling. Their heritage is long, and their views towards commerce is conservative. They have always done things one way, and they see no potential gain from changing their ways.

					<aside class="notes">
					Let’s take a step back and think about the most basic version of these terms. What is content?  Wikipedia defines as… just kidding. We are at a content management conference. Can we get a show of hands, who here does not know what content means? 

					Ok, so let’s rather think about what content means in the context of commerce. In the context of a commerce system built on a CMF it can mean the body text of your product. It means the pictures of your products. But it’s also much more. Let’s start with the first.

				<section>
					<img src="images/lamp.png" class="stretch" />
					<aside class="notes">
							Consider the lamp. Here is a screenshot that is manipulated. It is a lamp that costs more than 1200EUR. It has one picture and no useful info. Kjøpe en cord. For me as a consumer, I would need to be convinced about why I would spend that kind of money on a lamp, but here there is no compelling reasons. To make the parallel to a physical store, I would not buy this lamp unless someone working there would come over and explaining the wonderful features of the lamp. Or maybe it’s exclusive material. Or lifetime guarantee. So in its simplest form, content driven e-commerce is actually providing content that the consumer needs to make the decision to make a purchase. Good pictures and good text drives sales. With Drupal, we have the tools to create this content. Which would not be the case if your Product inventory management system looks like this (win 3.11 picture).

					<aside class="notes">
							But this is not something I am making up myself. It is also one of the findings in the research project I referred to:

					<img src="images/atle.png" class="stretch" />
					<aside class="notes">
						But I also want to use an example from my own childhood. This is my friend Atle reading in a catalogue about finnish hardcore punk. Why is this relevant? Because if you consider the catalogue as a list of titles and their prices, we would never have purchased anything from this. But they used a lot of editorial resources so we could actually read about the artists, and have enough information to buy records without ever hearing the artists before.
					</aside>

					<div data-markdown="">
						## What is content?
						## What is driven?
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
							So first, we have seen: What is content? It is description and images. What is driven? Driving sales. Convincing the customer. 

							To return to our story: We have now seen Romeo from the content family not only accompanying Julian and the commerce family, but actually providing value that directly makes their family business better. So Julian loves Romeo, but despite having family differences even Romeo’s family seems to tolerate Julian.
